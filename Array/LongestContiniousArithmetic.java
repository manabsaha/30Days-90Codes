/* GOOGLE KICKSTART PROBLEM
An arithmetic array is an array that contains at least two integers and the differences between consecutive 
integers are equal. For example, [9, 10], [3, 3, 3], and [9, 7, 5, 3] are arithmetic arrays, while [1, 3, 3, 7], 
[2, 1, 2], and [1, 2, 4] are not arithmetic arrays.

Sarasvati has an array of N non-negative integers. The i-th integer of the array is Aáµ¢. She wants to choose 
a contiguous arithmetic subarray from her array that has the maximum length. Please help her to determine the 
length of the longest contiguous arithmetic subarray.
